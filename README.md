About
-----

Tower of Mystery is a text-only adventure game published in Gary McGath's
1984 book [COMPUTE!'s Guide to Adventure Games](https://archive.org/details/Compute_s_Guide_to_Adventure_Games). The object of the game is
to explore an abandonded multi-floor building, solve some simple puzzles,
and to use an in-game computer to create a copy of an Adventure game tape.

The Guide to Adventure Games mostly contained reviews of then-current
adventure games, along with general tips and tactics for solving them.

The game was included at the end of the book for readers to type into
their own personal computer. Typing programs in from a printed listing
was common in 1980s computer magazines and books. The main purpose for
this was as a method of analog software distribution.

The secondary purpose was education. Typing a program into a computer by
hand was a slow process. Programming this way was a method for novices
to learn programming basics through copying and imitation. McGath's
book contained a substantial explanation of the program in the chapter
following the program listing, highlighting Tower of Mystery's educational
purpose.

Setting
-------

In the book, Gary McGath named the setting as, "The old factory of
the adventure is, in fact, a real building in Manchester, NH, which
now houses several high-tech companies" (p. 165). A few years ago,
I met Gary via Reddit and he confirmed for me that he had in mind the
Jefferson Mill building specifically. The picture of the building above
shows the factory with its prominent clock tower.
